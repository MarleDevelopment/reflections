When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    When collaborating with others or working on different computers on the same
    file it is useful to upload the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Manual pushes leave control to the user when and what update from
	GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
	Forks are copies/clones of GitHub repositories.
	Clones are copies/clones of any repository.
	Branches are variations of files within a repository.
	
	When you start to manipulate a file within a repository or you
	create a new feature, you work on branches.
	If you want to copy a repository and work on it without affecting the
	original you should clone it.
	Cloning a GitHub repository on GitHub is called forking.
